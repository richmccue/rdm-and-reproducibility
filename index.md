# Research Data Management for Reproducible Research

- Pre-workshop activities: 15 min 
- Workshop Videos : 32 min

## Why is Reproducibility important? 

Reproducible research establishes the validity of scholarly output and contributes to reasearcher credibility and reliability. Across disciplines, researchers have been calling for reproducible research as an attainable minimum standard for assessing the value of scholarly claims, particularly when full independent replication of a study is not feasible. 

Data management is foundational to establishing reproducibility and its practices must be implemented throughout the course of a research project. 

## Learning objectives 

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Evaluate the reproducibility crisis
2. Examine challenges of creating reproducible research data
3. Discuss foundational data management practices 
4. Review available tools that facilitate reproducible research data
